## Purpose and scope
The document serves as a formal proposal prepared for a client that outlines hardware procurement and custom PC build services tied to Alpine IntelliVIEW software deployment.​

It covers two main parts: selecting a prebuilt workstation and server that meet Alpine’s requirements, and designing five custom desktop PCs, all within defined budget and project constraints.​

## Company and project framing
Quantum Quirk Solutions is presented as a custom PC and hardware solutions provider focused on high‑performance, reliable systems for professional and business use, with a clear vision and mission around “freeing data” and empowering users.​

The executive summary highlights local and online suppliers, verified compatibility via PCPartPicker, and the emphasis on enterprise/workstation‑grade components to ensure long‑term reliability.​

## Technical content
The document restates Alpine IntelliVIEW’s detailed hardware requirements for both workstation and server, including CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, OS, and network specifications.​

Later sections describe chosen workstation/server specs, custom component lists and justifications, compatibility checks, an itemized invoice, and terms and conditions for the proposed build.
