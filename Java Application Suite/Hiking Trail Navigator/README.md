## Kiko's Hiking Trail Navigator

* This is a text-based hiking adventure simulation that lets users issue commands (go, look, help, reset, quit) to explore a virtual trail system. The player navigates through locations (Trailhead, Forest, Ridge, Waterfall, Summit) by issuing direction-based commands (north, south, east, west).
 
 * Journey history, coloration, and simple palindrome/backtracking logic are incorporated for dynamic responses.
   
 **Usage:**
 * Type 'help' for available commands and tips.
 * Move using 'go {direction}'. Directions allowed: north, south, east, west.
 * Type 'look' to observe your surroundings.
 * Type 'reset' to return to the trailhead.
 * Type 'quit' to exit the program.
